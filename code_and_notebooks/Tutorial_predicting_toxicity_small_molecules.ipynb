    "The above pipeline, in the standardization steps, include the following procedures:\n",
    "   \n",
    "1. `metal_disconnector`: remove metal atoms. Disconnecting metal ensures that the core organic molecules are properly analyzed as metals re not well-represented in cheminformatics.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. `salt_remover`: Removes salt counterions (e.g., Na+, Cl-, K+) from the molecule. These ions are often added during synthesis or purification but are not part of the active molecule. These salts can artificially inflate the molecular weight or alter properties like solubility, leading to incorrect predictions and are irrelevant to the biological activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. `element_filter`: In this step molecules containing elements other than the default elements (H, B, C, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Se, Br, I) are replaced with an `InvalidInstance` to instead of removing it and avoid inconsistencies with the initial input. This element filter is needed to avoid feature representation problems as unusual elements may not be properly encoded, they may also introduce noise or irrelevant patterns, and disturb the capacity of the model to capture meaningful biological information. **It is important to apply this filter only after disconnecting metals aor removing salts to avoid removing compounds of interest**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. `uncharge`: Neutralizes charged molecules by adjusting protonation states (e.g., converting -COO⁻ to -COOH or -NH₃⁺ to -NH₂). Charged molecules can have different physicochemical properties (e.g., solubility, reactivity) compared to their neutral forms. Uncharging ensures consistency in molecular representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. `canonical_tautomer`: Converts the molecule to a standardized tautomeric form. Tautomers are isomers that can interconvert by the movement of a proton and a double bond (e.g., keto-enol tautomerism). Tautomers can have different chemical properties, but they represent the same molecule in equilibrium. Without standardization, the same molecule could be represented in multiple ways, leading to inconsistencies in predictions, affecting the model reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. `stereo_remover`: Removes stereochemical information (e.g., chiral centers, double bond stereochemistry) from the molecule. Stereochemistry can significantly affect molecular properties (e.g., biological activity), but if only a part of the training data include stereochemistry, considering it in the input can lead to incorrect predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additional standardazation steps can be added. Chech [RDKit standardization module documentation](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/source/rdkit.Chem.MolStandardize.html) or [MolVS documentation](https://molvs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/guide/standardize.html).

    "- 2D features are descriptors that describe the molecular topology based on the graph representation of the molecules, e.g. the number of rings or the number of rotatable bonds.\n",
    "- 3D features are descriptors geometrical descriptors that describe the molecule as a 3D structure.\n",
    "- 4D features are descriptors that describe the molecule as a 4D structure. A new dimension is added to characterize the interactions between the molecule and the active site of a receptor or the multiple conformational states of the molecule, e.g. the molecular dynamics of the molecule.\n",

    "Calculating 3D features requires the generation of 3D conformers, which can be computationally expensive for large molecules. In addition, some features may not be available for certain molecules, e.g. 3D features cannot be calculated for molecules that do not have a 3D structure. Some tools like DeepMol provide methods for generating compound 3D structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data driven methods**: These are descriptors based on deep learning, pretrained models and LLMs strategies that encode molecules into abstract latent spaces, representing molecular similarities as simple distance measures between numerical vectors. Furthermore, molecular descriptors have expanded beyond chemistry, integrating relevant biological data from heterogeneous bioactivity assays. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is currently a huge amount of these methods comming out every day. This work of [The WhiteLab](https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2025/sc/d4sc03921a) presents a critical review of these tools depending on the case.
